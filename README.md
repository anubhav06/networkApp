This is a twitter-like networking web application called `Network` made using Django and JavaScript  
Users can Create Post/Edit a post, Follow/Unfollow a user, Like/Unlike a post  

Deployed at https://django-network-app.herokuapp.com/.

This was made to understand the concepts of Django and Web Development. Also, the best way to understand is by building a real world existing project. Thus, presenting 'Network' which helps in understanding how to make a social-networking web application.

### How we built it

The backend is built using `Django` framework. While the frontend is built using `HTML, CSS and JavaScript`.
